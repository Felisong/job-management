# Hello, Welcome to my tiny Job App

Here I will be uploading a very simple job application management webapp. I will use tools I am familiar with as well as some I am not so used to.

The plan is simple and I will write it here

React cuz I know it

Node / Expressjs because I know it as well

MongoDB for ease of use I feel very comfy with PSQL

and docker to run these all from.

## Used

- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)
- [Claude][https://claude.ai/new]
