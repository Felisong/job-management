# Hello, Welcome to my tiny Job Application Management Web App

This is an web app meant for me mostly. While trying to job hunt I wanted an easy way to track all my applications. The goal was to make it as easy to view and use. I'm currently using an excel sheet, but thought making this would be a fun way to learn.

My plans are to add AI to help write your cover letter and resume inside the web app, make user accounts for storing your own job applications, making it look professional and easy.

I also made this to learn how to use docker in development.

### Goals

- Create the Create function endpoint and have an easy way to add new jobs now.
- With that I have full CRUD operations on the jobs.
- From here I want to design overhaul for a bit on the front end and make it look a bit more acceptable
  === stretch goals ====
- Create users.
- Start with MongoDB on the intended structure
- attach my user ID to all entries so far since they're mine
- Test this
- Then look into AI implementation
