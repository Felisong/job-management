# Hello, Welcome to my tiny Job Application Management Web App

This is an web app meant for me mostly. While trying to job hunt I wanted an easy way to track all my applications. The goal was to make it as easy to view and use. I'm currently using an excel sheet, but thought making this would be a fun way to learn.

My plans are to add AI to help write your cover letter and resume inside the web app, make user accounts for storing your own job applications, making it look professional and easy.

I also made this to learn how to use docker in development.
